- "What's the weather?"
- "Will it rain today/tomorrow?"
- "Temperature in [city]"
- "Weather forecast for the week"
- Travel planning weather checks

## When NOT to Use

- Historical weather data → use weather archives/APIs
- Climate analysis or trends → use specialized data sources
- Severe weather alerts → check official NWS sources
- Aviation/marine weather → use specialized services (METAR, etc.)

## Location

Always include a city, region, or airport code in weather queries.
